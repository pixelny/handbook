# Benefits & Perks

## Benefits

### Health Insurance

Health insurance is provided in the US via Oscar Health. The company pays 50% of the premium and the employee pays the other 50%. Open enrollment is in November every year.  Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally.

#### Employee-portion of medical insurance premium per pay period

* Employee-only medical coverage: $52.99
* Employee-partner medical coverage: $122.43
* Employee-child(ren) medical coverage: $118.47
* Employee-family medical coverage: $187.90

#### Employee-portion of dental insurance premium per pay period

* Employee-only dental coverage: $5.95
* Employee-partner dental coverage: $12.58
* Employee-child(ren) dental coverage: $15.08
* Employee-family dental coverage: $23.40

#### Vision

* Pixel doesn't offer vision insurance, but our medical insurance plan gives us discounts on eye exams, glasses, and contact lenses. 

#### Flexible Spending Account (FSA)

The FSA is an account where you can set aside pre-tax money for out-of-pocket medical expenses, such as prescriptions, over-the-counter medicine, vision care, etc. You have to decide up front how much money you want to put in the account, and the max is $2,400/year.  There is a separate type of FSA for dependent care (child or elder care), and the max for that plan is $5,000/year. This is an entirely optional program; if you don't think you'll use it, you need not sign up.  

### Vacations & Holidays

Pixel offers 3 weeks of paid vacation and the standard national holidays every year. Make sure to check with your team before taking any extended absence.

### Summer Hours

During summer, half days on Fridays, aka "summer hours". Summer hours are in effect from May 1 through August 31 each year.  (An employee who've just been hired may have to complete a training program per their team lead to be eligible).

### Sabbatical

Every three years, employees are eligible to take a one-month-long paid sabbatical. Just give a heads-up preferably three months in advance, so we can coordinate the work-load accordingly.

### Parental Leave

When you welcome a new child (birthed or adopted), Pixel encourages you to take up to 12 weeks leave for primary caregivers and up to 6 weeks leave as secondary caregiver at 100% paid salary. You may also choose to take an additional 8 weeks leave unpaid.

### 401K Retirement Plan

Pixel currently does not offer a 401K matching plan. We ofset that by paying a higher salary to allow employees to make their own financial choices.

## Perks

### Fitness Allowance

Pixel will pay up to $25/month for your gym membership, yoga studio membership, or whatever activity you do to stay in shape. If it's not organized fitness, that's okay, too. You can use your stipend to pay for race registrations or even new outdoor running shoes. The only catch is that you can't "save up" your stipend. Sorry, but no saving 9 months worth of fitness benefit, and buying a new bike; this benefit is meant to promote regular activity for you. 

### Streaming Music

A Spotify Premium account is available to each employee upon request.  

### Continuing Education Allowance

If you're interested in taking classes that you feel improve you professionally or personally, you have a $500 annual stipend to do so (annual = a 12 month period, not necessarily 2017 or 2018). Some people take classes directly related to their career, while some take photography lessons or learn a musical instrument. It's up to you; the point is to learn something that you feel enriches you as a person and employee.

### Matching Charitable Gifts

When you donate money to a qualified charity, Pixel will make a matching gift to that charity on your behalf. Pixel will match up to $1,000 per year, per employee.

## Practical assistance

### Expense Account

If you work in the US, you should carry a Pixel American Express card in your name. You can use the card for any work-related expenses, such as travel, software, or office supplies. If you have any doubts about whether or not to expense something, just ask. When you do buy something with the card, get a receipt! Take a photo of that receipt and send it to Expensify. If you can’t use the Amex and have to use a personal card, send the receipt directly to Andrea for reimbursement.

Pixel has no expense policy. We trust our employees to spend money wisely. If you’re booking a flight, you don’t need to buy the cheapest, 2-layover redeye; buy the convenient, well-priced seat. If you’re attending a conference on behalf of Pixel, sure, Pixel will buy your meals. Just try to stay away from caviar and champagne at dinner (okay, maybe once if you have a killer day to celebrate). If you have questions about what “spend it wisely” means, just ask!
