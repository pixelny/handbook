# Getting Started

## Expectations
Getting started at Pixel can be overwhelming. There are a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, you're learning a new job and new coworkers, and you're likely doing all these things while working remotely. If you don't know how to set up your machine (or *why* you're setting up something on your machine!), please ask. There is no set time period for most training periods, but most people are up to speed in about 3 months.
